Roboartes Searching Detection Robot is an autonomous vehicle project that I received a grant within the scope of TUBITAK 2209A. The robot scans around to find the defined box in the system and continues scanning until it finds the right box. When the robot finds the right box, it takes the box autonomously and takes to the defined shelf in the system.
