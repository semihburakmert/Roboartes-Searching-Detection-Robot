 Roboartes Searching Detection Robot is an autonomous vehicle project that
I have been the to taked grant holder of grant support under TUBITAK 2209A. 
The robot scans around to find the box defined in the system and continues 
scanning until it finds the right box. When the robot finds the right box, 
it takes the box autonomously and takes it to the rack defined in the system.
